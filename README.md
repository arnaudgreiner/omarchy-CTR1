# Omarchy CTR1

Fork of [cucu0628/omarchy-dashboard (Asked Dashboard)](https://github.com/cucu0628/omarchy-dashboard)
— MIT, (c) cucu0628. Local additions: network / Bluetooth / audio merged into the dashboard.

An Omarchy Shell bar widget that extends the centered clock with a three-view
dashboard. The bar displays the day and time; clicking it opens the Overview,
Media, and Weather views.

## Features

### Top Bar

- Configurable day and time format.
- Stacked clock rendering for left and right vertical bars.
- Open or close the dashboard with a left click.
- Uses the active Omarchy theme colors, font, spacing, and borders.
- Only one widget instance can be placed on the bar.

### Overview

- Monthly calendar with Monday as the first day of the week.
- Previous and next month controls.
- Highlight for the current day.
- Cover art, title, and artist from the active MPRIS source.
- Previous, play/pause, and next controls.
- Continuously updated, seekable playback progress bar.
- CPU, memory, and root disk usage.

### Media

- Large cover art and detailed media metadata.
- Previous, play/pause, and next controls.
- MPRIS playback position updated every 500 ms.
- Current and total playback time.
- Seekable playback progress bar.
- Per-player MPRIS volume control for the selected media source.
- Source selector when multiple MPRIS players are available.
- Filters the `playerctld` proxy to avoid duplicate sources.

### Weather

- Current temperature and weather icon.
- Apparent temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
- Five-day forecast with minimum and maximum temperatures.
- Uses the existing Omarchy weather location setting.
- Fetches data from the Open-Meteo API.

## Requirements

- Omarchy 4 or newer with the current Omarchy Shell plugin API.
- Quickshell with MPRIS support.
- `bash`, `curl`, `awk`, `df`, and the Linux `/proc` filesystem.
- An internet connection for weather data.
- An Omarchy Nerd Font-compatible font for icons.

This plugin is Linux- and Omarchy-specific. It cannot be used unchanged in an
unrelated Quickshell configuration because it depends on Omarchy's `qs.Commons`
and `qs.Ui` components.

## Installation

### From a Git Repository

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/arnaudgreiner/omarchy-CTR1.git --enable --yes
```

Omarchy clones the repository into:

```text
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/omarchy-CTR1/
```

### Manual Installation

Place the complete plugin directory at:

```text
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/omarchy-CTR1/
```

Then rescan and enable it:

```bash
omarchy-shell shell rescanPlugins
omarchy plugin enable omarchy-CTR1
```

Verify the installation with:

```bash
omarchy-shell shell listPlugins
```

The `omarchy-CTR1` entry should have `enabled` set to `true`.

## Top Bar Configuration

The default section is `center`. To replace the stock clock, replace the
`omarchy.clock` entry in the center layout of
`~/.config/omarchy/shell.json` with:

```json
{
  "id": "omarchy-CTR1",
  "format": "dddd HH:mm"
}
```

Set `centerAnchor` to the dashboard as well:

```json
"centerAnchor": "omarchy-CTR1"
```

Do not replace your entire `shell.json` with a short example. That file may
also contain the rest of your bar layout, idle timers, and other plugins.

The Shell normally reloads configuration changes automatically. If it does
not, run:

```bash
omarchy restart shell
```

## Clock Format

The `format` setting accepts a Qt date and time format.

| Setting | Example |
|---|---|
| `dddd HH:mm` | `Saturday 12:30` |
| `ddd HH:mm` | `Sat 12:30` |
| `HH:mm` | `12:30` |
| `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` | `2026-08-15 12:30` |

For a vertical bar, use `verticalFormat`. The default value renders the hour,
a separator, and the minutes as three stacked bar slots:

```json
"verticalFormat": "HH\n—\nmm"
```

## Usage

- Click the clock on the top bar to open or close the dashboard.
- Use the `OVERVIEW`, `MEDIA`, and `WEATHER` tabs to switch views.
- Use the calendar arrows to change the displayed month.
- Click or drag a playback progress bar to seek.
- The volume bar controls the selected MPRIS player's own volume.
- When multiple players are active, source buttons appear at the top of the
  Media view.
- Press `Escape` to close the panel.

The playback progress bar is enabled only when the selected MPRIS player
supports seeking and reports the total media length. Some live streams do not
provide these capabilities.

## IPC

The dashboard can also be controlled directly:

```bash
omarchy-shell omarchy-CTR1 open
omarchy-shell omarchy-CTR1 close
omarchy-shell omarchy-CTR1 toggle
```

These commands can be used from scripts or Hyprland keybindings.

## Weather Location

The plugin reads the existing Omarchy weather state file:

```text
~/.local/state/omarchy/settings/weather.json
```

Expected format:

```json
{
  "name": "Veszprem",
  "latitude": 47.09327,
  "longitude": 17.91149
}
```

Use the Omarchy weather location tool instead of editing the file manually:

```bash
omarchy-weather-location --set "Budapest"
```

Weather data refreshes every 15 minutes. The plugin uses this Open-Meteo
endpoint:

```text
https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast
```

## Data Sources

| Data | Source |
|---|---|
| Date and time | Quickshell `SystemClock` |
| Media | `Quickshell.Services.Mpris` |
| Application volume | Selected MPRIS player's `volume` property |
| CPU | `/proc/stat` |
| Memory | `/proc/meminfo` |
| Disk | `df -P /` |
| Weather | Open-Meteo HTTPS API |

System statistics refresh every three seconds while the panel is open.

## Theming

The plugin does not define a fixed color palette. It uses the following shared
Omarchy values:

- `Color.background`, `Color.foreground`, and `Color.accent`
- `Color.popups`
- `Style.font`
- `Style.spacing`
- `Style.cornerRadius`
- `Border.controlSpec`

As a result, Omarchy theme, font, and scaling changes are reflected in the
dashboard automatically.

## Permissions and Privacy

Omarchy Shell plugins are not sandboxed. Their QML code runs inside the
`omarchy-shell` process. Always review a plugin before installing it.

This plugin:

- reads local system statistics;
- controls MPRIS players owned by the current user;
- changes the selected MPRIS player's own volume;
- sends the configured weather coordinates to Open-Meteo;
- does not request elevated privileges;
- does not maintain its own database or history file.

## Troubleshooting

### The Plugin Does Not Appear

```bash
omarchy-shell shell rescanPlugins
omarchy plugin enable omarchy-CTR1
omarchy restart shell
```

Ensure that both the directory name and the manifest ID are
`omarchy-CTR1`.

### The Panel Does Not Open

```bash
omarchy-shell omarchy-CTR1 open
quickshell log --pid "$(pgrep -n quickshell)" --tail 100 --no-color
```

### No Media Information Is Shown

Check whether the player exports an MPRIS service:

```bash
busctl --user list --no-pager
```

The output should contain a service named `org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.*`.

### Seeking Is Disabled

The selected player or content probably does not support the MPRIS seek
operation. This is common for live streams and media with an unknown length.

### Volume Control Does Not Work

Confirm that the selected player exports the MPRIS `volume` property. The
slider is disabled when the application does not support MPRIS volume control.

### Weather Is Missing

- Check the `weather.json` state file.
- Check your internet connection.
- Configure the location again with `omarchy-weather-location`.
- Previously loaded weather data remains visible if a refresh fails
  temporarily.

## Development

Changes under `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/omarchy-CTR1/` are normally
detected automatically by Omarchy Shell. To rescan manually:

```bash
omarchy-shell shell rescanPlugins
```

For a clean restart:

```bash
omarchy restart shell
```

Basic JSON and JavaScript validation:

```bash
jq empty manifest.json
node --check Model.js
```

Check runtime QML errors with:

```bash
quickshell log --pid "$(pgrep -n quickshell)" --tail 150 --no-color
```

## Updating

To update a Git-managed installation:

```bash
omarchy plugin update omarchy-CTR1 --yes
```

If necessary, restart the Shell afterward:

```bash
omarchy restart shell
```

## Removal

For an Omarchy-managed installation:

```bash
omarchy plugin remove omarchy-CTR1
```

If the dashboard replaced the stock clock, restore the `omarchy.clock` entry
and set:

```json
"centerAnchor": "omarchy.clock"
```
